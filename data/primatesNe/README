data for the analyses presented in Brevet and Lartillot 2019
Reconstructing the history of variation in effective population size along phylogenies
bioarxiv.org/content/10.1101/793059v1

prim.phy: multiple sequence alignment (subset of Perelman et al, 2011. A molecular phylogeny of primates. PLoS Genet 7(2):e1001342)
prim.rootedtree: phylogenetic tree (rooted with Tupaia as the outgroup of primates)
prim.calib: fossil calibrations

nohyperprim.lht: life-history traits, including generation time (from Anage database), combined with estimates of pi_S and pi_N/pi_S (from Figuet et al, 2016, Life-history traits, protein evolution and the nearly-neutral theory in amniotes. Mol Biol Evol, 33(6):1517-27)

hyperprim.lht: life-history traits, including generation time (from Anage database), combined with estimates of pi_S and pi_N/pi_S estimated using the hypergeometric sampling method.
