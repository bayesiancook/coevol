## Compilation ##

To compile, run 'make' from root directory.

After modifying code structure (new files, new includes), run 'make clean; make' so cmake is re-run.

## Formatting ##

This code is formatted according to a specific style described in the .clang-format file (mostly Google-style with bigger indentation).
To automatically format all the code, run 'make format' (this requires clang-format).
